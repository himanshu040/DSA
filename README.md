Roman to Integer â€” Java Solution

Date: 10/05/2025

ðŸ“˜ Problem Statement

Seven symbols represent Roman numerals:

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numerals, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
Solution: Understand that Roman numerals are generally written in descending order of value, and their values are added.
